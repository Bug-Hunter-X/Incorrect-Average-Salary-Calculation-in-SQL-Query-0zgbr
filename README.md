This repository contains a common SQL error related to the incorrect calculation of the average salary within a WHERE clause. The `bug.sql` file demonstrates the erroneous query, which attempts to compare individual employee salaries to the average salary across all employees. The `bugSolution.sql` file provides the correct solution using a subquery to calculate the average salary for the Sales department before the comparison.
